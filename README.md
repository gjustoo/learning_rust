# LEARNING RUST BY MYSELF

Hi, im following a youtube crash course for Rust lang.  
I've heard about Rust a while ago,  and I find pretty interesting that it doesn't have any garbage collector.
So i thought to give it a try.

## My objectives

- Learn the basics
- Learn ownership and borrowing
- Learn concurrency
- Create a small program
- Create small project
- Learn web frameworks ( Rocket?)

## Completed objectives:
    - Basic sintax
